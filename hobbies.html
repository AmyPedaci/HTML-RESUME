    <h1>My Top Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Aquiring New Skills</h2>
        <p>I have a deep love for learning and have always loved picking up new skills and seeing how I can intergrate them into my current work to expand my capabilities. My current hobbies are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Coding</li>
            <li>Spanish</li>
            <li>User Experience Design</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>Reading has always been apart of my daily routine. While I enjoy fantasy books I also find the non-fiction books can be quite fasinating and they are at the core of my learning routine. My current favorite books that I have read so far this year are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>"The Design of Everyday Things" By Don Norman</li>
            <li>"Madrigal's Magic Key to Spanish" By Margarita Madrigal</li>
            <li>"The Fourth Wing" By Rebecca Yarros</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Fitness</h2>
        <p>I believe the key to a strong mind is through daily phisical exercise. This has improved my work dramatically by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strengthening my discipline and resolve</li>
            <li>Keeping me focused on the task at hand</li>
            <li>Keeps me striving to be 1% better each day</li>
        </ul>
